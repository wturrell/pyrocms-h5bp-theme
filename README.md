For when *Minimal* is too fancy...

A barebones copy of HTML5 Boilerplate (using version 3, 6 Feb 2012) as a PyroCMS theme.
This is the stripped (comment free) version.  Header, footer and metadata partials only.

It includes modernizr, jQuery (CDN and local fallback) and the H5BP CSS.
Google Analytics excluded as PyroCMS handles that.

For more on HTML5 Boilerplate, see http://www.h5bp.com/
